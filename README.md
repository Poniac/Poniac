- ✌🏽 Hi, I’m @Poniac
- 👀 I’m interested in softwares building 
- 👨🏾‍💻 I’m currently learning software development 
- 🫱🏾‍🫲🏼 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner's projects 
- 🗣️ But right now, I need a roadmap to learn software development, 'cause I'm self-studying. I've just finished a HTML/CSS but not confident enough to start coding. 
- 🫡 I'd be grateful for some help.
